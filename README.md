# PN005_merus_audio_ctl

A basic command line controller for the Merus Audio MA1270P amplifier. At present, it mainly reads and interprets the various control registers available, but planning to add pretty much full functionality over time.

_Some of the channel monitor registers need checking given the datasheet is unclear to exactly what bit values relate to what setting_
